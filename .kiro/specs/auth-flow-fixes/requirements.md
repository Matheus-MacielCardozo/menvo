# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical authentication flow issues in the mentorship platform that are preventing users from completing the onboarding process. The main problems include: middleware conflicts, role selection failures due to database permission errors, inconsistent user metadata handling, and broken authentication state management. These issues must be resolved to launch the platform by the 28th of this month.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user logging in with OAuth (Google/LinkedIn/GitHub), I want my authentication to work seamlessly without middleware conflicts, so that I can access the platform without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes OAuth authentication THEN the middleware SHALL properly handle the authentication state without conflicts
2. WHEN the middleware processes authentication THEN it SHALL use a single, consistent approach for creating Supabase clients
3. IF there are multiple middleware implementations THEN the system SHALL use only one consolidated approach
4. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the middleware SHALL properly update cookies and session data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a new user who has just signed up, I want to select my role (mentor/mentee) successfully, so that I can complete my onboarding process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to select a role THEN the system SHALL have proper database permissions to access the roles table
2. WHEN the role selection API is called THEN it SHALL successfully update the user's profile with the selected role
3. IF a user has role "pending" THEN the system SHALL show the role selection modal
4. WHEN a role is selected THEN the user's JWT claims SHALL be updated to reflect the new role
5. WHEN role selection is complete THEN the user SHALL be redirected to the appropriate next step

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want user metadata to be consistently managed across OAuth providers and manual registration, so that all users have proper profile data regardless of signup method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up via OAuth THEN their profile SHALL be created with consistent field mapping
2. WHEN a user signs up manually THEN their profile SHALL be created with the same structure as OAuth users
3. IF user metadata contains conflicting role information THEN the system SHALL prioritize the database profile role over JWT claims
4. WHEN user metadata is updated THEN both the profile table and JWT claims SHALL be synchronized
5. WHEN a user's role changes THEN the system SHALL trigger a JWT refresh to update claims

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with pending status, I want the authentication flow to guide me through the required steps (role selection, profile completion, verification), so that I can complete my account setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has status "pending" and no role THEN the system SHALL show the role selection modal
2. WHEN a mentor completes role selection THEN the system SHALL guide them to profile completion
3. WHEN a mentor completes their profile THEN the system SHALL show validation pending status
4. IF a user tries to access protected routes without completing required steps THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the appropriate onboarding step
5. WHEN onboarding steps are completed THEN the user SHALL be able to access their intended destination

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication context to provide accurate and up-to-date user state information, so that components can make proper authorization decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the authentication context loads THEN it SHALL provide accurate user, profile, and claims data
2. WHEN user data changes THEN the context SHALL automatically refresh and update all dependent components
3. IF there are discrepancies between JWT claims and profile data THEN the system SHALL resolve them consistently
4. WHEN authentication state changes THEN all components using the auth context SHALL receive updated information
5. WHEN the user signs out THEN all authentication state SHALL be properly cleared

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle authentication errors gracefully, so that I receive clear feedback when something goes wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database permission errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to the user
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the user SHALL be redirected to an appropriate error page with clear instructions
3. IF JWT token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and prompt for re-authentication
4. WHEN API calls fail due to authentication issues THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages
5. WHEN Supabase configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully with appropriate warnings
